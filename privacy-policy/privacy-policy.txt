We don’t store your data. We're not interested in your data. Your data's old hat. We didn't even want to look at your data before we were like "nah, better not..... they're
probably just going to get angry and it's not even worth it." Your data is boring. I don't want to see what you're Wikipediaing at 3 AM when insomnia strikes and you've
convinced yourself you've come down with a rare sort of brain-eating bacteria. I'm sure you find it captivating enough to keep you awake for another two hours when you
really should be going to sleep because you have a busy day at work the next day, but honestly, Kate or Mark or Dan or Sarah-with-an-H, it's not that interesting, so

just

get

over

yourself.
















But seriously, we respect your data and monitor and store nothing.
